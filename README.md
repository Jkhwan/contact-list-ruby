### Lighthouse Labs Week 3 Day 3 Assignment - Contact List (Ported to Sinatra)

##### The purpose of this assignment is to first add database integrated to the command line contact list application built on W3D1 and then finally port it to Sinatra. Unfortunately, no styling has been implemented in the web interface at this point.

The user will be able to create, list, find, and show all contacts from the main menu. They are also allowed to edit a particular entry, and add multiple phone numbers to each contact. Finally, the contact list is persisted in a SQLite database.
